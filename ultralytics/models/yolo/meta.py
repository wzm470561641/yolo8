        Conducts object tracking on the specified input source using the registered trackers.

        This method performs object tracking using the model's predictors and optionally registered trackers. It handles
        various input sources such as file paths or video streams, and supports customization through keyword arguments.
        The method registers trackers if not already present and can persist them between calls.

        Args:
            source (str | Path | np.ndarray | Image.Image | torch.Tensor | list[str | Path | np.ndarray | Image.Image | torch.Tensor]): Specifies the data source for inference. Can be an image path, video file, directory, URL, or device ID for live feeds. Supports a wide range of formats and sources, enabling flexible application across different types of input.
            conf (float): Sets the minimum confidence threshold for detections. Objects detected with confidence below this threshold will be disregarded. Adjusting this value can help reduce false positives.
            iou (float): Intersection Over Union (IoU) threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Lower values result in fewer detections by eliminating overlapping boxes, useful for reducing duplicates.
            tracker (str): Tracker type to use for object tracking, such as 'bytetrack' or 'botsort'.
            stream (bool): If True, treats the input source as a continuous video stream. Defaults to False.
            persist (bool): If True, persists trackers between different calls to this method. Defaults to False.
            imgsz (int | tuple[int, int]): Defines the image size for inference. Can be a single integer `640` for square resizing or a (height, width) tuple. Proper sizing can improve detection accuracy and processing speed.
            half (bool): Enables half-precision (FP16) inference, which can speed up model inference on supported GPUs with minimal impact on accuracy.
            device (str): Specifies the device for inference (e.g., `cpu`, `cuda:0` or `0`). Allows users to select between CPU, a specific GPU, or other compute devices for model execution.
            max_det (int): Maximum number of detections allowed per image. Limits the total number of objects the model can detect in a single inference, preventing excessive outputs in dense scenes.
            vid_stride (int): Frame stride for video inputs. Allows skipping frames in videos to speed up processing at the cost of temporal resolution. A value of 1 processes every frame, higher values skip frames.
            stream_buffer (bool): Determines if all frames should be buffered when processing video streams (`True`), or if the model should return the most recent frame (`False`). Useful for real-time applications.
            visualize (bool): Activates visualization of model features during inference, providing insights into what the model is "seeing". Useful for debugging and model interpretation.
            augment (bool): Enables test-time augmentation (TTA) for predictions, potentially improving detection robustness at the cost of inference speed.
            agnostic_nms (bool): Enables class-agnostic Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which merges overlapping boxes of different classes. Useful in multi-class detection scenarios where class overlap is common.
            classes (list[int]): Filters predictions to a set of class IDs. Only detections belonging to the specified classes will be returned. Useful for focusing on relevant objects in multi-class detection tasks.
            retina_masks (bool): Uses high-resolution segmentation masks if available in the model. This can enhance mask quality for segmentation tasks, providing finer detail.
            stream (bool): Returns a generator for memory efficient processing.
            show (bool): If `True`, displays the annotated images or videos in a window. Useful for immediate visual feedback during development or testing.
            save (bool): Enables saving of the annotated images or videos to file. Useful for documentation, further analysis, or sharing results.
            save_frames (bool): When processing videos, saves individual frames as images. Useful for extracting specific frames or for detailed frame-by-frame analysis.
            save_txt (bool): Saves detection results in a text file, following the format `[class] [x_center] [y_center] [width] [height] [confidence]`. Useful for integration with other analysis tools.
            save_conf (bool): Includes confidence scores in the saved text files. Enhances the detail available for post-processing and analysis.
            save_crop (bool): Saves cropped images of detections. Useful for dataset augmentation, analysis, or creating focused datasets for specific objects.
            show_labels (bool): Displays labels for each detection in the visual output. Provides immediate understanding of detected objects.
            show_conf (bool): Displays the confidence score for each detection alongside the label. Gives insight into the model's certainty for each detection.
            show_boxes (bool): Draws bounding boxes around detected objects. Essential for visual identification and location of objects in images or video frames.
            line_width (None or int): Specifies the line width of bounding boxes. If `None`, the line width is automatically adjusted based on the image size. Provides visual customization for clarity.

        Returns:
            (list[Results] | Generator[Results]): A list, or generator when `stream==True`, of tracking results, each a Results object.

        Raises:
            AttributeError: If the predictor does not have registered trackers.

        Examples:
            >>> model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
            >>> results = model.track(source='path/to/video.mp4', show=True)
            >>> for r in results:
            ...     print(r.boxes.id)  # print tracking IDs

        Notes:
            - This method sets a default confidence threshold of 0.1 for ByteTrack-based tracking.
            - The tracking mode is explicitly set in the keyword arguments.
            - Batch size is set to 1 for tracking in videos.

        Validates the model using a specified dataset and validation configuration.

        This method facilitates the model validation process, allowing for customization through various settings. It
        supports validation with a custom validator or the default validation approach. The method combines default
        configurations, method-specific defaults, and user-provided arguments to configure the validation process.

            dnn (bool): If `True`, uses the OpenCV DNN module for ONNX model inference, offering an alternative to PyTorch inference methods.
            plots (bool): When set to `True`, generates and saves plots of predictions versus ground truth for visual evaluation of the model's performance.
            rect (bool): If `True`, uses rectangular inference for batching, reducing padding and potentially increasing speed and efficiency.
            split (str): Determines the dataset split to use for validation (`val`, `test`, or `train`). Allows flexibility in choosing the data segment for performance evaluation.

        Returns:
